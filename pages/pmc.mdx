Systems engineers face challenges in creating cost-effective, reliable, and rapidly-deployable industrial control units, especially with the increasing use of AI/ML in automation. Development boards offer quick solutions but can lead to disorderly setups, while PLCs, despite their reliability, have limitations in cost and specialization. 


Paisley Microsystems' PMC series provides a new option, combining the cost-effectiveness of development boards with the form factor and ease of PLCs, offering a seamless hardware and software compatible solution in the form of DIN-rail sized controllers and functional modules. The PMC series' unique compute enabled features make it an advantageous choice for AI/ML-involved applications. High-power compute options includes the well-documented RPi(r) Compute Modules and NVIDIA embedded AI SoMs like the ORIN(r) NX/AGX modules.

The PMC series not only enables system integrators with powerful controller options, but also includes functional modules catering to a variety of needs such as low-latency IO, complex motor drive, and field interfaces such as CAN or 4-20mA loops; all designed to fit seamlessly in both physical form and function. 

An integrated software solution for code-generation is also in the works and nearing release. The packaged solution will configure and generate firmware, middleman programs for PMC systems in minutes.
Paisley Microsystemsâ€™ PMC Series of control products allow developers and engineers to direct their valuable time and resources towards the innovations that make your company unique.
