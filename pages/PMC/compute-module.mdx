# Compute Module

![PMC-C-CMX](/images/pmc/closeup.jpg)

The PMC-C-CMX features a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 or 5 (CM4/CM5). 

- 2x HDMI 4k60p 1.4b
- 2x2 MIPI CSI/DSI (3/5 Lane)
- 4, 3 or 1 native USB 2.0 ports*
- PCIe 3.0 8GT/s support
- M.2 B-Key and M-Key form factor support (30x30/42/80mm)

## Flashing the OS

The CM4/5 can be flashed with an operating system in multiple ways:

### USB flashing

Connect the board via USB and use the Raspberry Pi usbboot utility to flash the eMMC.

### Preloading with SD card (non-CM4Lite only)

For full CM4 modules with SD card support, you can preload the OS image onto a microSD card. Insert it into the module before powering on.

## Using M.2 PCIe devices

The PMC-C-CMX M.2 slot supports NVMe SSDs for additional storage. The Samsung 990 EVO has been confirmed as bootable. Cellular modems with a nano-SIM slot are also supported in the B-key slot.

### Configuring cellular support

Cellular modem functionality can be configured in the host operating system running on the CM4/5. Consult the modem manufacturer's documentation for setup instructions.

## GPIO mapping and using HATs

The PMC-C-CMX breaks out the CM4/5's GPIO to a 40-pin header compatible with the Raspberry Pi HAT specification. Refer to the provided GPIO mapping table for pins used by onboard functionality. Unused GPIOs can interface with custom or off-the-shelf HATs.

## Video interfaces

Dual HDMI and 4-lane MIPI DSI allow connection of up to two 4k60 displays or high resolution MIPI displays. The 2-lane MIPI CSI interfaces enable use of compatible cameras.

## Real-time clock

An onboard PCF85063AT RTC chip with crystal maintains date/time when the system is powered off. It supports wake-on-alarm and interrupt functionality.

## RS-485 Profibus-DP compatible transceiver

The high-speed RS-485 transceiver supports speeds up to 20Mbps, suitable for PROFIBUS-DP industrial networks. TX/RX are on GPIOs 12/13.
