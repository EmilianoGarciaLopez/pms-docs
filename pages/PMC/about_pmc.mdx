## Compute Module

The PMC-C-CMX features a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 or 5 (CM4/CM5). Key features include:

- 2x HDMI 4k60p 1.4b
- 2x2 MIPI CSI/DSI (3/5 Lane)
- 4, 3 or 1 native USB 2.0 ports\*
- PCIe 3.0 8GT/s support
- M.2 B-Key and M-Key form factor support (30x30/42/80mm)

### Flashing the OS

The CM4/5 can be flashed with an operating system in multiple ways:

#### USB flashing

Connect the board via USB and use the Raspberry Pi usbboot utility to flash the eMMC.

#### Preloading with SD card (non-CM4Lite only)

For full CM4 modules with SD card support, you can preload the OS image onto a microSD card. Insert it into the module before powering on.

### Using M.2 PCIe devices

The PMC-C-CMX M.2 slot supports NVMe SSDs for additional storage. The Samsung 990 EVO has been confirmed as bootable. Cellular modems with a nano-SIM slot are also supported in the B-key slot.

#### Configuring cellular support

Cellular modem functionality can be configured in the host operating system running on the CM4/5. Consult the modem manufacturer's documentation for setup instructions.

### GPIO mapping and using HATs

The PMC-C-CMX breaks out the CM4/5's GPIO to a 40-pin header compatible with the Raspberry Pi HAT specification. Refer to the provided GPIO mapping table for pins used by onboard functionality. Unused GPIOs can interface with custom or off-the-shelf HATs.

### Video interfaces

Dual HDMI and 4-lane MIPI DSI allow connection of up to two 4k60 displays or high resolution MIPI displays. The 2-lane MIPI CSI interfaces enable use of compatible cameras.

### Real-time clock

An onboard PCF85063AT RTC chip with crystal maintains date/time when the system is powered off. It supports wake-on-alarm and interrupt functionality.

### RS-485 Profibus-DP compatible transceiver

The high-speed RS-485 transceiver supports speeds up to 20Mbps, suitable for PROFIBUS-DP industrial networks. TX/RX are on GPIOs 12/13.

## STM32H7 controller

An onboard STM32H7B0 microcontroller enables real-time IO control and offloads the CM4/5. It features:

- 128KB flash / 1.4MB RAM
- 280MHz max clock speed
- 16MHz and 32.768kHz crystals
- 58 total GPIOs (4x16 + 1x8)

### Flashing firmware

#### Using the SWD header

An 8-pin header exposes the STM32's SWD interface for flashing and debugging using an ST-LINK or compatible probe.

#### Using the UART bootloader (OTA)

The STM32 supports flashing over its UART interface. A bootloader program running on the CM4/5 can send the firmware image.

### GPIO mapping

Refer to the STM32H7 GPIO table for pinout. All GPIOs are tolerant to 25kV ESD per IEC 61000-4-2.

## Power input

The PMC-C-CMX can be powered through the terminal block or USB-C PD input.

### Wire/Terminal input

- 7-55V input range (10A max)
- Reverse polarity protection

### USBC PD input

- Supports USB PD 2.0 with up to 45W power profiles
- User-programmable power delivery profiles\*\*\*

#### Flashing the STUSB NVMe

The NVMe parameters can be configured by flashing the STUSB controller through its programming header.

## PMC modular bus

The PMC modular bus allows connection of PMC IO modules for additional functionality.

### SPI control

SPI control signals (CS, CLK, MISO, MOSI) allow high-speed communication with PMC modules at up to 24Mbps.

### I^2C control

#### GPIO expander

An I2C GPIO expander allows control of module-specific functions. The interface supports 2Mbps speed.
