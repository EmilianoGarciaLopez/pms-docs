# STM32H7 controller

An onboard STM32H7B0 microcontroller enables real-time IO control and offloads the CM4/5. It features:

- 128KB flash / 1.4MB RAM
- 280MHz max clock speed
- 16MHz and 32.768kHz crystals
- 58 total GPIOs (4x16 + 1x8)

## Flashing firmware

### Using the SWD header

An 8-pin header exposes the STM32's SWD interface for flashing and debugging using an ST-LINK or compatible probe.

### Using the UART bootloader (OTA)

The STM32 supports flashing over its UART interface. A bootloader program running on the CM4/5 can send the firmware image.

## GPIO mapping

Refer to the STM32H7 GPIO table for pinout. All GPIOs are tolerant to 25kV ESD per IEC 61000-4-2.
