# i2c-interfaced IO module



The i2c-interfaced varient PMC-IO-IGP uses the [TCA9535](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tca9535.pdf) i2c port expander chip. The relevant register tables are found starting at page 21.

The default address of the chip is 0x74, which can be changed with the ADDRESS DIP switch to allow up to 8 different addresses. Using an i2C scanner is always a good idea to avoid conflicts, as some boards may also have integrated i2c preipherals such as the GPIO expander on the PMC-C-CMX.


**NOTE:** Changing the address configuration during operation is not recommended and may result in i2c glitches.
