# PMC modular bus

The PMC modular bus allows connection of PMC IO modules for additional functionality. The pinout is given below:

All signals are 3.3V logic level, INPUT bus can be from 7-55V.

## SPI control

SPI control signals (CS, CLK, MISO, MOSI) allow high-speed communication with PMC modules at up to 24Mbps.

## I^2C control

### GPIO expander

An I2C GPIO expander allows control of module-specific functions. The interface supports 2Mbps speed.
